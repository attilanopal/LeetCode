**According to triangle inequality theorem, for any given triangle, the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third side. **
​
**Formula :**
**a + b > c
b + c > a
c + a > b**
​
​
Ex :
Provided three line : a (10), b (20), c (15)
10 + 20 > 15
20 + 15 > 10
15 + 10 > 20
Because all of those equation results is true
Line a, b, and c can form a triangle
